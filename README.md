## 2D Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks implemented in PyTorch

The architecture of ```Conv2dLSTMCell``` was inspired by "Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting" 
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04214.pdf).

See the image below for the key equations of ```Conv2dLSTMCell```:
